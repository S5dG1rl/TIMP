Task 1: (any string)
Task 2: (any string)
Task 3: (func, left, right, epsilon, maxIter)
    "2*x + 1", "-2", "2", "0.0001", "50" -> "-0.5" (linear equation)
    "x*x - 4", "0", "3", "0.0001", "100" -> "2.00024" (quadratic equation)
    "x*x*x - 2*x - 5", "1", "3", "0.0001", "100" -> "2.09456" (cubic equation)
Task 4: (text)
    "1 4 1*2=3 1*3=2 2*3=1 2*4=5 3*4=2" -> "1 -> 3 -> 4 (length 4)" (easy graph)
    "2 5 2*3 2*4 3*5 4*5" -> "2 -> 4 -> 5 (length 2)" (graph with edges without weights)
    "1 6 1*2=4 1*3=2 2*3=1 2*4=5 3*5=10 4*5=2 4*6=6 5*6=2" -> "1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (length 12)" (graph with edges with weights)
